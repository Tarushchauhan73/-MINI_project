                                                      ABSTRACT

This project aims to design, develop, and implement a Comprehensive Patient Care System within the Health Sector by leveraging advanced technologies. It addresses the increasing demand for patient-centric approaches and the challenges of achieving seamless interoperability among healthcare systems. The project’s scope encompasses the adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, the rise of mobile health applications, and the need for patient engagement and remote monitoring tools. By focusing on standardisation, collaboration among healthcare providers, and the establishment of a comprehensive telemedicine infrastructure, the projects seeks to enhance patient care, improve healthcare processes, and increase operational efficiency.

                                               PROBLEM FORMULATION
  • According to a report by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) in the United States, as of 2020, over 90% of hospitals had adopted electronic health record (EHR) systems and even the use of mobile health applications is on the rise. 

• As of 2019, there were over 318,000 health apps available on major app stores, with the number of mHealth app downloads expected to reach 3.7 billion globally by 2022. 

FUTURE SCOPE
Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI can analyze vast amounts of medical data to identify patterns, predict potential health risks, and personalize treatment plans. AI-powered chatbots can answer patient queries and even triage basic health concerns.

Telehealth and Virtual Care: Video conferencing and remote monitoring will enable more convenient and accessible healthcare, especially for those in remote areas or with mobility limitations.

Precision Medicine: Advancements in genomics and personalized medicine will allow for treatments tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup, leading to more effective and targeted therapies.

Patient Empowerment: Patients will have greater access to their health data and play a more active role in managing their own health. Educational tools and apps will  promote self-care and preventative measures.

Focus on Prevention: The emphasis will shift from reactive treatment to preventative measures.  This could involve using AI to identify people at risk of certain diseases and intervene early.
